# RATZAM-8 Assembler

`assembler.py` is a Python script that assembles human-readable `.asm` source code into machine code (`.mem`) for the **RATZAM-8** CPU and simulation.  
It supports labels, comments, immediate values, direct addressing, and I/O operations.

---

## Assembly Language Syntax

### 1. Comments
- Begin with `;` and run to the end of the line.  
- Ignored by the assembler.

Example:
LDA #05    ; Load 5 into accumulator

### 2. Labels
- A word followed by `:` defines a label at the current program counter (PC).  
- Labels are symbolic addresses, useful for jumps and loops.

Example:
loop:  DEC
       JNZ loop   ; jump back to "loop"

### 3. Opcodes
Each instruction maps to a machine code defined in the ISA (Instruction Set Architecture). Examples:

LDA #05    ; Load immediate
STA &20    ; Store ACC into memory at 0x20
OUT &01    ; Output ACC to port 1
IN  &02    ; Read from port 2 into ACC
HLT        ; Halt execution

### 4. Operands
- Immediate (`#`): literal constant.
Example:
LDA #10     ; ACC = 10

- Direct (`&`): memory or I/O address.
Example:
STA &30     ; RAM[0x30] = ACC

- Label: symbolic address, resolved at assembly time.
Example:
JNZ loop

## Usage

### Assemble a program
python3 assembler.py program.asm program.mem

- `program.asm` = input assembly source file  
- `program.mem` = output memory image (one byte per line in hex, e.g., `0xNN`)  

### Run with GHDL Simulation
The `.mem` file can be loaded directly into the RATZAM-8 simulation:

ghdl -r tb_cpu8 --wave=out.ghw --mem=program.mem

*(Adjust depending on your testbench options.)*

## Example

### `countdown.asm`
; Countdown demo
LDA #05
loop: OUT &01
      DEC
      JNZ loop
      HLT

### Assemble
python3 assembler.py countdown.asm countdown.mem

### Result (`countdown.mem`)
0x04 0x05   ; LDA #05
0x1E 0x01   ; OUT &01
0x0A        ; DEC
0x14 0x01   ; JNZ loop
0x01        ; HLT

---

## Features
- Labels and forward references resolved automatically  
- Supports immediate (`#`), direct (`&`), and label operands  
- Outputs compact `.mem` file suitable for GHDL testbenches  
- Comments (`;`) ignored gracefully  

---

## Limitations
- Only supports RATZAM-8 ISA (custom 8-bit instruction set)  
- No macros, expressions, or complex directives (yet)  
- All instructions assumed to be 1â€“2 bytes
